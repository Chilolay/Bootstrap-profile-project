                    <h5>Scientific name: Tillandsia</h5>
                    <h5>Family: Bromeliaceae</h5>
                    <p>Tillandsia, commonly called Air plants are a type of epiphyte that belong to the bromeliad
                        family. They can be found in the tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.
                </div>
                <div class="col">
                    <strong>Soil requirements:</strong> Air plants do not require soil to grow. They absorb moisture and
                    nutrients through their leaves from the air. They are commonly grown in containers or mounted on
                    driftwood, rocks, or other decorative elements.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Light Requirements:</strong> Air plants light requirements vary by species but all will
                    thrive in bright, indirect light. They can tolerate direct sunlight in the morning or late
                    afternoon, but too much direct sun can scorch their leaves. Place them near a window with filtered
                    light or in a spot that gets bright, indirect sunlight for most of the day. You can also use a full
                    spectrum grow light if you can't meet the natural light requirements.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Watering Requirements:</strong> Air plants require regular watering, but how often they need
                    water depends on the humidity level and the air circulation
                    in the room. When watering it's best to soak your plant in water every 7-10 days. Make sure to
                    submerge the
                    entire plant in water for 6-12 hours, then shake off any excess water and allow it to dry completely
                    before putting
                    it back in its container. Dry air in your home due to heating or air conditioning makes misting your
                    plant unlikely to support it's water needs for long. As far as water quality air plants prefer rain
                    water, filtered water, or tap water allowed to sit for chlorine to dissipate. Never use ditilled
                    water as it will kill your plant.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Temperature Requirements:</strong> Air plants prefer temperatures between 50-90°F (10-32°C).
                    They can tolerate temperatures outside of this range for short
                    periods, but prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures can harm the plant.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Container Requirements:</strong> Air plants can be kept in a variety of containers,
                    including glass terrariums, hanging baskets, or decorative bowls. If
                    you're using a container, make sure it has drainage holes or is wide enough to allow air circulation
                    around the plant. It's important to note that your display does not have any copper wire as it's
                    poisonous to air plants.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Air Circulation:</strong> Good air circulation is something that is often overlooked for air
                    plants, as it helps to prevent excess moisture from building up on the leaves.
                    You can improve air circulation by placing a small fan near your air plants or by keeping them in a
                    location with good
                    air flow such as near an open window.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Fertilization:</strong> While air plants can absorb nutrients from the air, they will
                    benefit from occasional fertilization. You can use a
                    specially-formulated air plant fertilizer, or a water-soluble fertilizer diluted to half strength.
                    Fertilize your air
                    plants once a month during the growing season (spring and summer) and reduce fertilization during
                    the dormant season
                    (fall and winter).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Pest Control:</strong> Air plants are relatively pest-resistant, but they can occasionally
                    be affected by spider mites or mealybugs. If you
                    notice any signs of infestation, isolate the affected plant and treat it with an insecticidal soap
                    or neem oil.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Propogation: </strong> Propagating air plants is relatively easy, and can be done by
                    removing and replanting the offsets (also known as "pups")
                    that grow at the base of the parent plant. Here's how to do it:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Wait until the offset is at least 1/3 the size of the parent plant and has several leaves of
                            its own.
                        </li>
                        <li>Use a sharp, clean pair of scissors to cut the offset away from the parent plant at its
                            base. Be careful not to damage the parent plant or the roots of the offset.
                        </li>
                        <li>Allow the cut ends to dry for a few hours to prevent rotting.
                        </li>
                        <li>Once the cut ends are dry, you can plant the offset in a new container or attach it to a new
                            decorative element, such as a piece of driftwood or a wire frame.
                        </li>
                        <li>Mist the newly planted offset with water and place it in a location with bright, indirect
                            light.
                        </li>
                        <li>Care for the new plant as you would any other air plant, and it should begin to grow and
                            thrive on its own.</li>
                    </ol>
                    With proper care, the new offset will develop into a mature air plant and eventually produce its own
                    offsets, continuing
                    the cycle of growth and propagation.
