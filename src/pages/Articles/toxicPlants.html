                    There are many houseplants that are toxic to humans and pets and most of them are more common than
                    you'd think. A few words of warning and advice before we get to the list.
                    <br />
                    Before purchasing a new plant check if it's poisonous and to what degree so you can make an informed
                    decision on if it's the right plant for you. When researching plants remember plants may have
                    several common names but will only have one botanical name. Do not grow potentially toxic plants within reach
                    of children or pets.
                    <br />
                    Exposure to poison is caused by ingestion of plants or plant parts and/or contact with the skin.
                    Ingestion of plant parts can cause internal poisoning, heart or kidney failure. Skin contact can
                    produce symptoms such as dermatitis and allergic reaction.
                    <br />

                    <strong>
                        If you're concerned about a child or pet you suspect consumed or touched a toxic plant go to an
                        emergency room, consult your veterinarian, or call the 24-hour <a
